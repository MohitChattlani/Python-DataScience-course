Matrix plots

1) Primarily heatmaps way of showing matrix plots
Data should already be in matrix form(variables on both col and rows)

tc=tips.corr()   #correlation- this gives a matrix form
column and index variable name indicates relevancy to col and index for the cell where they match

sns.heatmap(tc,annot=True,cmap="coolwarm")  #colors in value based on some gradient scale, numbers related to each other
annot- provides value as well along with colors
cmap-color map

fp=flights.pivot_table(index="month",columns="year",values="passengers")

sns.heatmap(fp,cmap="magma",linecolor="white",linewidths=1)

to separate boxes in heatmap

2) Cluster map

The clustermap uses hierarchal clustering(cluster cols and rows together based of their similarity) to produce a clustered version of the heatmap.

sns.clustermap(fp,cmap="coolwarm", standard_scale=1)

standard_scale - to normalize(0-1)
