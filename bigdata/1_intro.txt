Big data

We have worked with data that can fit on local computer (0-8 GB) i.e. data that can fit on RAM

Large Data. What to do?

1) Use SQL Database to move storage to Hard drive instead of RAM

2) Use distributed system, that distributes data to multiple machines/computer.

One machine/master node controlling distribution of multiple machines. Advantages: more processing power and memory than a single local machine.

					M(Master node) 
	M   M   M   M        M    M    M    M  (Other nodes distributed)

*A local process use computation resources of single machine

*A distributed process has access to computational resources across number of machines connected through a network

*After certain point it is easier to scale out to many lower CPU machines than to try to scale up to single machine with high CPU

*Easy scaling in distributed system, you can add more machines

*They also include fault tolerance, if one machine fails, the whole n/w can still go on
