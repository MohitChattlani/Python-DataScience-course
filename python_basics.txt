List comprehension

x=[1,2,3,4]

[num**2 for num in x]

Map and filter fns

def cross2(num):
	return num*2

list(map(cross2,x)) - list fn converts it to list object

Lambda expressions- Anonymous fns. Rewriting a function into a simple line of clean code. 

lambda num: num*2


Filter fns: Filter out elements from a sequence.
Filter must use a fn that returns a boolean value so that it can filter out elems

#filters out even elements in list
list(filter(lambda x:x%2==0,sequence))

<string>.split()
<string>.upper()

same as js
