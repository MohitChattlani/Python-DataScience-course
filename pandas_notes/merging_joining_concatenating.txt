Concatenation

glues together df. Dimensions should match along the axis you are concatenating on. 

#by default axis is 0.(It will join rows together)
pd.concat([df1,df2,df3])

   A  B   C   D
0  A0 B0  C0  D0
1  A1 B1
2  A2

axis=1 for columns

Check notebook for o/ps

Merging

The merge function allows you to merge DataFrames together using a similar logic as merging SQL Tables together. For example:

pd.merge(left,right,how="inner",on="key")

#multiple keys
pd.merge(left, right, on=['key1', 'key2'])

pd.merge(left, right, how='outer', on=['key1', 'key2'])

Joining

Joining is a convenient method for combining the columns of two potentially differently-indexed DataFrames into a single result DataFrame.

left.join(right)

left.join(right, how='outer')
